#Time To Travel!
##Automate the traffic check

###What does it do?
This script will query the Google Maps API and send a text to your phone with the estimated travel time.

###How does it do it?

 1. Request to Google Maps API
 2. Parse response for duration_in_traffic
 3. Email your phone the results, which comes through as a text

###Why?

I got tired of checking the traffic every day before I left work. It was just an extra step I didn't need. So why not automate it?
